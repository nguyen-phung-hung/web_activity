          In the software industry patent trolls are buying broad and vague
          patents to sue companies for money. These patent trolls do not
          produce, innovate, or distribute their own products and rely on
          lawsuits as their main source of income. Oftentimes these patent suits
          will lose with only about 25% of them winning and the most aggressive
          patent trolls will only win 10% of the time. Despite these chances of
          winning, startups and smaller companies will be forced to settle as
          they simply can’t afford the lawyer fee to defend themselves. This
          method of earning money decreases innovation, gatekeeps key
          technology, and slows the industry's growth. Companies instead of
          investing in their employees and producing products will be forced to
          slow down their growth to pay for lawsuits. These software patents are
          especially dangerous because software patents can be vague and broader
          than patents for physical products.

      <div class="section1_box" style="flex-direction: row-reverse">

        <div>
          <p>
            In order to solve this problem of patent trolls we can generate
            awareness of the problem. Like many people, I wasn’t even aware that
            patent trolls were even a problem so how could people have fought
            against it? Patent trolls are especially dangerous to startups and
            smaller companies in the company. Creating awareness and public
            pressure on these patent trolls can allow for more technologically
            advanced businesses to stay in the area. I think it would be best to
            spread awareness from places of education like high schools,
            community colleges, and universities as there could be potential
            inventors who would be affected by these patent trolls. We can start
            by promoting non-profit organizations like the EFF(Electronic
            Frontier Foundation) that fight directly against patent trolls and
            lobby Congress to improve patent legislation. They want to impose
            stricter regulations on the creation of patents so that only truly
            innovative and unique technologies will be patented.
          </p>
          <p>
            A second step we can take is to encourage tech companies and new
            inventors to join the LOT network. This is also a nonprofit
            organization, but its purpose differs from EFF. They aim to gather
            groups of companies, schools, and people to join together and create
            a patent immunization shield that would prevent the possibility of a
            lawsuit happening in the first place. They do this by giving all
            their members a lifetime licensing agreement of a patent every time
            a patent is sold out of the network. This means that even if a
            patent is sold outside of the network it could not be used against
            any company that was already in the network, effectively creating a
            shield.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third method we can use is supporting or joining the Unified
            Patents. They are a member-based organization that focuses on
            challenging bad patents. Their goal is to remove badly made patents
            all over the world, but their operation is still mainly in the U.S.
            By challenging the legitimacy of these badly made patents they
            prevent them from being used maliciously by patent trolls. Their
            members will also get various benefits like up-to-date information
            on newly made patents and future litigation suits.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can support the EFF(Electronic Frontier Foundation) They seem to
            fight to lower the copyright period. They also seem to be against
            patents trolls
          </p>
          <p>
            There was the shield act(The Saving High-Tech Innovators from
            Egregious Legal Disputes (SHIELD) Act was introduced by Rep.
            DeFazio, Peter A. [D-OR-4] in 2012 It did not seem to pass because
            of no support in Congress.
